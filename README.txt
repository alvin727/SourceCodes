This project is to address the lack of a metro style file explorer in Windows 8.1

It may look old-fashioned and out-of-place, but file explorer is still fundamentally the starting point for most works done on a computer.

This is because the search could not possibly cover each and every single folder and files in a modern home desktop or laptop.  The harddisk are way too large and the cloud based storage is still too inconvenient for everyday usage.
